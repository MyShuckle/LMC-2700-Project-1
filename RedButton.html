            <p>My current major at Georgia Tech is the Computational-Media major, and my thread is the Intel-Games thread.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><img src="Images/Question2.png" alt="Question 2"></th>
                    <th class="textchanger">What do you like and what do I not like at Georgia Tech?</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>This is a surprisingly <strong>difficult</strong> question to answer. As a result, I have dedicated a simple page dedicated to what I like and what I don't like about Georgia Tech. <a href="YellowButton.html">That page is here.</a></p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th><img src="Images/Question_Squares.png" alt="Question 3"></th>
                    <th class="textchanger">What do you like to do in your free time?</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>There's really no <b>one specific thing</b> I do during my free time. When I'm not grinding out assignments, I generally watch random youtube videos, and the youtube videos I generally watch don't really have a particular theme in mind, it's just <strong>whatever that comes up in my brain first.</strong></p>

                <tr>
                    <th><img src="Images/Question4.png" alt="Question 4"></th>
                    <th class="textchanger">How can I ask you additional questions that aren't listed here?</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>You can ping me in the Georgia Tech discord server, and ask them there! Discord username is MyShuckle, and generally kinda active in the Tech discord server, especially when I try to ask others about help in various topics.</p> -->
